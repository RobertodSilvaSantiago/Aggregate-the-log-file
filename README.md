# Aggregate-the-log-file

This code performs the following tasks:

It defines a multi-line string LOG_FILE_CONTENT that represents a log file containing domain names and their corresponding hit counts.
There is a function called get_clean_domains that takes a log file as input and returns a list of cleaned domain names. It parses each line of the log file, extracts the domain name, and cleans it by removing any subdomains or extraneous parts. The cleaned domain names are stored in a list.
Another function called count_accesses takes the log file and the list of clean domain names as inputs. It counts the total number of accesses for each domain by iterating through each line of the log file. It updates a dictionary called domain_accesses with the domain name as the key and the total number of accesses as the value.
The code also includes a function called format_output that takes the domain_accesses dictionary and formats it as a string. It aggregates the total accesses for domains with the same name (ignoring subdomains) and sorts the domains in descending order based on the total number of accesses. It then creates a string representation of the domain names and their total accesses, filtering out domains with fewer hits than the specified min_hits value.
The count_domains function combines the previous functions to extract the domain names and their hit counts from the log file, and formats the output as a string using the format_output function.
The main function sets the log_file variable to the LOG_FILE_CONTENT string and specifies a minimum number of hits (min_hits) as 500. It then calls the count_domains function with the log file and minimum hits as arguments, and prints the resulting output string.
Finally, the main function is executed if the script is run directly as the main program, ensuring that the functionality is invoked.
